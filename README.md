# No Prying Eyes
NPE is a simple Minecraft mod that aims to give the user control over the collection of their data and attempts to free the game of Microsoft's control.

## Information

- Minecraft version: 1.19.1-pre4
- Mod version: 0.3.0
- Mod loader: Fabric
- Fabric version: 0.14.8+
- Fabric API: 0.57.2+1.19.1

## Features
These are features that Mojang implemented under Microsoft that NPE simply disables and
allows you to enable them manually.

- Serverside option to enable Microsoft chat reporting
- Clientside option to enable telemetry
- More features planned

## Reason

I am of the belief that online privacy is a right that everyone has and
the collection of data by big tech should be optional. You have no obligation to share personal
information with said companies and said companies do not have the right to collect data on the users of their product.

The newest version of Minecraft implemented telemetry data collection and account bans by allowing players
to report each other to Microsoft instead of the server moderators.

Microsoft should not be involved in the moderation of players on third party servers and they do not attain
the right to collect your user data. (This being my personal take on it)

Also I just kinda wanted to make this mod for fun...
