# No Prying Eyes
NPE is a simple Minecraft mod that aims to give the user control over the collection of their data in an attempt to free the game.

## Information

- Minecraft version: 1.19.2
- Mod version: 1.19.2-v1.3.0
- Mod loader: Fabric
- Fabric version: 0.14.9+
- Fabric API: 0.60.0+1.19.2

## Features
All of these features are configurable and enabled by default.

- Disable chat reporting using 2 different modes
- Disable telemetry data collection
- (Clientside) bypass global bans
- Disable profanity filter
- Fake ban (yes, pretend to be banned)
- More features planned

## Reason

I am of the belief that online privacy is a right that everyone has and
the collection of data by big tech should be optional. You have no obligation to share personal
information with said companies and said companies do not have the right to collect data on the users of their product.

The newest version of Minecraft implemented telemetry data collection and account bans by allowing players
to report each other to Mojang instead of the server moderators.

Mojang should not be involved in the moderation of players on third party servers and they do not attain
the right to collect your user data. (This being my personal take on it)

Also I just kinda wanted to make this mod for fun...
